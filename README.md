# ChallengeScripts
A repository for scripts related to challenges I have completed.

Challenge 1 - JS reversing: https://pentest.join.eset.com/js-reverzing 
--------------
This challenge required participants to reverse engineer a JavaScript function to obtain the correct credentials. The password needed to match character code 42, however, you could also analyse the code and write a script to solve the challenge for you.

Challenge 2 - Over the Wire Natas: https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/
--------------
Natas is a wargame which teaches the basics of web-security, focusing on server side exploitation.
